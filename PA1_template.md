# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data


```r
#Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

#Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```

```r
#histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
library(ggplot2)
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.2.2
```

```r
total_steps_by_day <- aggregate(x = df$steps , by = list(df$date), FUN = sum ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(total_steps_by_day) <- c("date","steps")
histplot <- ggplot(total_steps_by_day,aes(x = steps)) +
            ggtitle("Daily steps") +
            xlab("Steps(binwidth 2000)") +
            geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000)
histplot

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



```r

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


```r
